```

## Gradio Interface

The Gradio interface provides a easy and user-friendly way to interact with our machine learning model.

### Running the Gradio App
1. Navigate to the gradio directory
2. Install requirements
3. Run the Gradio server

## Web Application

### Frontend
Our web application provides a more customized interface for model interaction using HTML and JS.



### API Backend
The API serves as the bridge between the frontend and the machine learning model using flask API endpoints .

#### API Endpoints
- `/predict` - Get model predictions

### Running the Web Application

#### Starting the API Server
1. Navigate to the api directory
2. Install dependencies
3. Start the server

#### Starting the Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory
2. run homepage.html
